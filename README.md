# D3-challenge

This repository contains the data and work for my Data Analytics D3 homework assignment.

For this assignment, I was tasked to use my knowledge of D3 to take an existing data set and demonstrate a relationship between some of the variables within a scatterplot.

The variables I chose to compare were Obesity % and Poverty %. After creating a scatterplot comparing the two variables, I improved the clarity of the chart by including state abbreviations within each data point, and stylized it to be appealing.
To capitalize on the interactivity of D3, I chose to include tooltips for each datapoint as well to further improve data clarity.
